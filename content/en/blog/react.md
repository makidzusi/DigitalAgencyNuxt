# React

## Declarative
Creating interactive user interfaces on React is nice and simple. It is enough for you to describe how parts of the application interface look in different states. React will update them in a timely manner when the data changes.

Declarative representations will make the code more predictable and simplify debugging.

## Based on components
Create encapsulated components with their own state, and then combine them into complex user interfaces.

Since the logic of the component is written in JavaScript, and not contained in templates, you can easily transfer a variety of data throughout the application and keep the state outside the DOM.

## Learn once — write anywhere
We don't need to know anything about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new functionality on React without changing existing code.

React can also run on the server using Node.js and on mobile platforms using React Native.
