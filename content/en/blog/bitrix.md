# Bitrix24 Overview: CRM system capabilities

When they talk about the most famous Russian CRM systems, Bitrix24 immediately comes to mind for many. This is not surprising, because in addition to sales management, 1C development helps to build transparent communication between employees, create online stores and websites, contact centers. One of the advantages of the system is compatibility with various devices, and therefore you can manage your business not only from a PC, but also from a mobile phone.

In our review of Bitrix24, we will tell you what features the system provides, and what are its main advantages over analogues.

## Bitrix Solutions

To install Bitrix24, you need to choose a suitable solution for yourself. The vendor offers 2 main formats:

- Cloud solution. The system is deployed on the developer's servers. The client pays for access to the IT product for 1, 3 or 12 months.

- Boxed solution. If the company has its own servers, or it wants to work with its proven data centers, then you can deploy Bitrix24 yourself by creating an independent system.

Regardless of which Bitrix solution the client chooses, the open source code allows you to refine the CRM system and adapt it to individual business needs. Sberbank experts will be able to adapt the system to the needs of the client.

## What does the system include?

Bitrix24 combines many different functions. Let's focus on each in more detail.

### Online office

The online office helps the company's employees to always be in touch, quickly coordinate various projects, documents and invoices. Online Office Features:

- Reporting and accounting of working hours. The employer can set a work schedule and monitor its compliance by employees. The employee himself can start or end the working day at any time, report on the work done.

- Messenger. In CRM, you can create an unlimited number of personal chats, bringing together employees of one department or department, project managers and executors to quickly exchange work issues.

- Video calls. In the application, you can communicate with 48 users at the same time. You can schedule a meeting in advance in the calendar or start in a chat. Video calls in HD format can be organized not only with company employees, but also with clients, as well as performers and contractors.

### CRM

CRM Bitrix24 opens up opportunities for effective business management. In a few clicks, the user will be able to connect warehouses, end-to-end analytics, social networks, advertising, telephony and mail. Also CRM:

- helps to automate sales — the system provides marketing robots and sales robots that will simplify routine business processes;

- analyzes leads — tells managers which client is more likely to want to use the services of the business, which ways can increase the company's profit;

- a single customer base — helps not to miss a single customer by collecting applications for goods, works or services of the company from different channels, ranging from social networks and phone calls and ending with forms on websites, while all information about customer interaction is saved.

### Tasks and projects

Companies often have a lot of repetitive routine work, and therefore it is quite difficult to track its effectiveness. Bitrix solves this problem — managers can set template tasks that are repeated every day, weekly or quarterly and monitor their implementation.

The system allows you to differentiate the functions of each employee:

- the task manager is a direct supervisor or a colleague from another department who needs help;

- responsible executor — an employee who will perform the work;

- co—executor - an employee who is also planned to be involved in working on the task;

- an observer — these may be assistants brought in by the responsible executor to work together, or other managers who are interested in the qualitative implementation of the task.

The calendar will help you track compliance with deadlines, and charts, checklists and lists will help you understand what the company has achieved, what work has been done.

### Landing pages and websites

Unlike other CRM systems that need to be integrated and "linked" to the site, Bitrix24 makes it possible to create landing pages and sites inside the system. Moreover:

- the created "pages" meet the SEO requirements of search engines, because they are much easier to promote and increase sales;

- landing pages and websites are adapted for users using mobile devices, and therefore there will be no situations when page design elements, feedback forms, text overlap each other. There is also a possibility to connect Google Analytics and Yandex Metrics.

Landing pages and websites created on Bitrix also work in conjunction with social networks — customers will be able to submit requests for services, goods and works from there.

### Online store

Creating an online store will take the user only 2 minutes. Just click the "Create" button, upload the first products to the catalog and wait for buyers. An important advantage is the special design of links for social networks, SMS and messages to messengers for potential or existing customers.

## Difficulties working with Bitrix24

A full review of the functions and capabilities of Bitrix24 would take an entire book. However, it is impossible not to mention the main difficulty of working with the system. Its disadvantage and at the same time its advantage is the need to adapt processes to the business on an individual basis. Unfortunately, it will be difficult for a simple user without minimal IT knowledge to configure CRM for himself. Therefore, when installing the system, it is recommended to involve experienced specialists who will not only adapt it to the user, but also teach how to work with it.

## Conclusions

Bitrix is not just a CRM system, it is a portal with huge capabilities and functionality for business. Its advantages:

- if desired, you can configure and use only the tools in demand, without overpaying for an IT solution. We strongly recommend using the Bitrix24 adaptation to be able to download all the data directly from the program, build analytical reports, etc.

- suitable not only for sales control, but also for the organization of the company's activities as a whole;

- it is possible to create landing pages, websites, online stores, link them with official business social networks and find your client on any platforms.
